## Hi, I'm Alcides Queiroz 👋🏽

> My website: https://alcidesqueiroz.com

I'm a **Full-Stack engineer** based in São Paulo, Brazil.

My passion lies in writing clean, maintainable and well-tested code, ensuring that software is not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain.

Over the past few years, I've been working mainly with **React**, **Redux**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, **Sanity**, **MongoDB**, **LLMs**, **Ruby on Rails**, **TanStack Query**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Angular (2+)**, **Sass**, and other related technologies.

Since 2022, I’ve been leveraging multiple AI-driven tools and integrations to enhance productivity and deliver innovative solutions. 

In my spare time, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences by writing technical articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alcidesqueiroz) and contributing to various F/OSS projects on GitHub.

I also have a great passion for [good design across various mediums](http://behance.net/alcidesqueiroz) (UI, web, typography, pixel art, animation, isometric illustrations, branding, and so on).
