## Hi, I'm Alcides Queiroz ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Brazilian **front-end engineer** and **JavaScript hacker** based in Amsterdam/Netherlands.

I love to write clean and maintainable code.

These days, Iâ€™m working mainly with **React**, **Redux**, **Next.js**, **Angular 2+**, **Jest**, **Material-UI**, **styled-components**, **Sass**, **Stylus**, and some other stuff.

Whenever I have free time, I like to write technical articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alcidesqueiroz) and to contribute to [F/OSS](https://github.com/alcidesqueiroz).

I also have a great passion for [good design in general](http://behance.net/alcidesqueiroz) (UI, web, typography, branding, isometric illustrations and so on).
