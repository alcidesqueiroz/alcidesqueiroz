## Hi, I'm Alcides Queiroz 👋🏽

> My website: https://alcidesqueiroz.com

I'm a **software engineer** based in São Paulo, Brazil.

My passion lies in writing clean and maintainable code, ensuring that software is not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain.

Over the past few years, I've been working mainly with **React**, **Redux**, **TypeScript**, **React Query**, **Tailwind CSS**, **styled-components**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, **Sanity**, **React Native**, **Angular 2+**, **Sass**, **Stylus**, and other related technologies.

In my spare time, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences by writing technical articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alcidesqueiroz) and contributing to various F/OSS projects on GitHub.

Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for [good design across various mediums](http://behance.net/alcidesqueiroz) (UI, web, typography, pixel art, animation, isometric illustrations, branding, and so on).
